# # Sample-Machine-Learning-Codes
This contains sample machine learning codes without using any of the modules.  

# Linear Regression
This contains sample multiple linear regression code. It can be used for simple linear regression too by modifying a bit. 

# Logistice Regression with regularization
Also, it contains logistic regression with or without regularization. Again, all this is done without using any modules or libraries. Pure gradient descent. 

# K-Means Clustering
Finally, there is K-Means Clustering Algorithm. There's not much implementation of K-means without the libraries online. This one is. However, here the number of clusters are determined seeing the 2D data. Once the number of clusters are determined manually then the algorithm is implemented.
